# Favorite code snippets: A responsibly sourced, artisanal list from the Lonely Coder's Club

The Lonely Coder's Club, a Slack community of newsroom programmers without big teams, would like to present our favorite, most-used code snippets. We've translated these snippets to most common coding languages and commented the heck out them so you can plug and play with ease!

Contributions, edits and additions are encouraged.
